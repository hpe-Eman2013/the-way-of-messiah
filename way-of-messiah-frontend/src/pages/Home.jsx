          We believe that the biblical model of meeting in private homes is the
          best way to create an atmosphere of personal accountability and
          self-governance. During the first century, the believers could not use
          the Synagogue as a place of worship and spiritual education, as they
          were persecuted by the Jewish leaders, who did not acknowledge or
          accept Yahusha as the Messiah. Therefore, they met in the homes of
          each other and were trained in the doctrine of Yahusha, the Son of
          Yahuah (or Yahuah, the Almighty One), as they preached the Gospel from
          house to house.

          <strong className="block text-xl mt-6 mb-2">Giving</strong>
          <br />
          We believe what the Bible admonishes about giving, that it should be:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Sacrificial</li>
            <li>Generous</li>
            <li>Reciprocal</li>
            <li>Willing</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="block text-xl mt-6 mb-2">Tithing</strong>
          <br />
          We do not practice tithing, which is the giving of a tenth of your
          earnings, but only ask that one gives according to what their heart
          has resolved.</p>
          <p><strong className="block text-xl mt-6 mb-2">Schools</strong>
          <br />
          It is said that "knowledge is power," and with the right knowledge one
          can achieve great things! The vision of our ministry is to open
          schools to train both young and old in various fields of study.
