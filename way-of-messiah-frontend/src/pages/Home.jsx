              <p>
                We believe that the biblical model of meeting in private homes
                is the best way to create an atmosphere of personal
                accountability and self-governance. During the first century,
                the believers could not use the Synagogue as a place of worship
                and spiritual education, as they were persecuted by the Jewish
                leaders, who did not acknowledge or accept Yahusha as the
                Messiah. Therefore, they met in the homes of each other and were
                trained in the doctrine of Yahusha, the Son of Yahuah (or
                Yahuah, the Almighty One), as they preached the Gospel from
                house to house.

              <p>
                We believe what the Bible admonishes about giving, that it
                should be:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Sacrificial</li>
                <li>Generous</li>
                <li>Reciprocal</li>
                <li>Willing</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <strong className="block text-xl mb-2">Tithing</strong>
              <p>
                We do not practice tithing, which is the giving of a tenth of
                your earnings, but only ask that one gives according to what
                their heart has resolved.
              </p>

                It is said that "knowledge is power," and with the right
                knowledge one can achieve great things! The vision of our
                ministry is to open schools to train both young and old in
                various fields of study.
